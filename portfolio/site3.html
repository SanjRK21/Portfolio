            <p><strong>Event Poster (Christkindlmarket)</strong></p>
            <p>For this assignment, I designed a poster for Christkindlmarket, an annual Chicago event my family and I love attending for its festive atmosphere. To create the poster, I used Adobe Illustrator and started by exploring layout options through grid exercises and typography hierarchies. After narrowing down my designs, I selected a light blue, dark blue, and white color scheme to capture a wintery Christmas vibe. Each text element was styled with a distinct typeface and color to emphasize its importance. I used stock Christmas decoration images, editing them in Photoshop to isolate specific elements. For the main graphic, I generated an AI image of a Christmas market in Illustrator and added snowflakes for a seasonal touch. The final design was printed at Staples, and I enjoyed bringing this festive project to life.</p>

            <p>Stickers (Diwali-Themed)</p>
            <p>For this assignment, I designed a set of Diwali-themed stickers to share and celebrate my culture through design. Diwali is one of my favorite festivals, and I wanted the stickers to reflect its vibrant colors and joyful traditions. I drew inspiration from symbolic elements like diyas (lamps), animals, and rangoli patterns, using the pen tool extensively to create detailed illustrations. For the typography, I chose a decorative typeface, Luminari, to complement the festive theme. The designs incorporate rich colors such as gold, pink, orange, and purple to evoke the warmth and celebration of Diwali, emphasizing the themes of joy and togetherness.</p>

            <p>Social Media Brand (Advertisements)</p>
            <p>For this assignment, I designed a series of ads for Glossier, focusing on their popular Milky Jelly Cleanser. Glossier emphasizes natural beauty over simply selling products, so I created ads that highlighted inclusivity and self-care—core elements of their brand. The headlines often featured the word “cleanse” to emphasize the product’s purpose, while the visuals showcased the cleanser itself or close-ups of models with natural skin. This approach aligns with Glossier’s style of featuring products in a real and relatable context. I used Photoshop extensively to edit images, refine details, and create clean, polished compositions.</p>

            <p>This is a poster that I designed for a ceasefire rally that was held at Harper College last year in response to the Israel-Gaza War. This event was hosted by Harper’s Amnesty International Club along with other clubs.</p>

            <p>This artwork features different angles of an apple cutter. The idea is to guess what the object is based on looking at these drawings at the different angles.</p>
